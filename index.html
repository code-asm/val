        <main>
            <p> I am extremely proud to be writing this for you. I cannot say enough about how much I dislike Nietzsche but I am still quoting him, "It's not a lack of love but a lack of friendship that makes unhappy marriages." I dedicate the song "Best Friend" by Jason Mraz to you, every line of the song and the whole album "YES!".</p>

			<p>You are the most amazing woman I have ever met. I love your fun loving, say yes attitude to life. It's inspiring and it means we always have a good time. I love your confidence, your resilience and how you never let anyone tell you what to do. I love what a good team we are, and no matter where life takes us, I know that we will continue to create a great life together filled with happiness, laughter and love.</p>

			<p>I know I could make hundreds of cute websites asking you to be my valentine or the use various other ways people ask their partner, but it's not me. I know I would have never thought of something like that myself, truly it would be a cute gesture but it wouldn't be me. I would rather pour my heart into writing about you than spending time curating a picture perfect website to ask you to be my valentine, sure it looks quirky but I don't want others to dictate us how love is expressed. This love is yours and mine, we choose our own ways. I would rather write you this cheeky essay on my love for you, sure it's not that aesthetic but it has my heart and soul.</p>

			<p>I know you are strong, I want you to stand for yourself, I want you to do everything you want to without depending on anyone but I also want you to know that I will hold your hand whenever you need. Above all, I want you to be true and kind to yourself. Try to live every day as if you will come back to this one day, to enjoy it, as if it was the best day of your extraordinary, ordinary life.</p>
			
			<p>I hope my love for you gives you strength and loving me gives you courage.</p>

			<p>I believe we don't have to make promises about being faithful, respectful, protecting, helping, loving you or to be with eachother at our lowest. I don't need promises to bind me to do these things. I would rather wake up and choose you day in and day out. I don't promise to love you unconditionally because I don't know what it means, I know it means exactly what it says in the dictionary but it would be such a shame to use a singular word to describe this feeling. I love you today the way I have always loved you. I love you today the way I loved you yesterday and I hope I love you the same way tomorrow and all the days ahead. I know the past and today but not the future. I could day that I want to love you more and more every day ahead but if there is any more of this love tomorrow it would be very mean of me to not love you more today than tomorrow.</p>

			<p>I can say I love you a hundred times but instead of writing those three hundred words I would rather borrow some ink from cupid and write about us to show you that I love you more those 300 words. I will never try to express in any way I am told to, I am nobody's slave in love. I am me and you are my person, I say to my person what and when my heart tells me not anyone else. All these people can move Mars for all I care. I like my love instinctive and personal. I care about making performance of my love as much as I care about the Kardashians.</p>

			<p>I love you more than Nic loves crystal meth, more than Guido loves Dora, *Buogiorno, Pricipessa!*, more than Amelie loves imagining how many couples are having an orgasm at that exact moment.</p>


			<p>I often ask you where would you like to live. When we are inside home it doesn't matter where we are but who is with us. If I had to choose between living in the most perfect country or with you, I would choose you because with you any country is perfect and without you every country is ugly. My screen is prettier than any European capital when I am talking to you. If I had to choose between reading all the books in the world or reading your lips, I would choose you. If I could learn all the tongues in the world or learn your tongue, I would choose you. If I could be the happiest person or hold your hands, I would choose you because I am the happiest with you. If I could be the wealthiest person in the world or ride bicycle with you. I'd rather laugh on a bicycle than cry in a Ferrari because I am the wealthiest when I'm with you. Life is beautiful with you when you are smiling.</p>

			<p>I am not a character from a romance novel, I am not perfect, life isn't perfect, but it's real. I am a common man, I've led a common life and my name will be forgotten but every ordinary has been extraordinary ever since you came into my life, so I want you to remember me forever.</p>

			<p>I am a little weird, and life is a little weird, your weirdness is compatible with mine and we fell into a mutually satisfying weirdness called love. Will you be my valentine once again?</p>
